# Snaplists
A simple list-making app for iOS &amp; watchOS. Its goal is an easy-to-use list app for the Apple Watch.

The app uses **Core Data** and **CloudKit** to sync data across Apple Watch and iOS devices.  The UI is built with **SwiftUI**.

The app is available in the **App Store** as a free download. There is an in-app purchase to unlock all functionality. 

Blog posts about the app's development are available at [sleekible.com](https://www.sleekible.com)
